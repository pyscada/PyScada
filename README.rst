PyScada a open source SCADA system
==================================

A Open Source SCADA System with HTML5 HMI, build using the Django framework. If you like to setup your own SCADA system head over to http://pyscada.rtfd.io.

Features
--------

- HTML5 based HMI
- Supports the following industrial Protocols
	* Modbus TCP/IP
	* Modbus RTU
	* Modbus ASCII
	* Modbus Binary
	* Phant http://phant.io/
	* VISA https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyVISA
	* 1-Wire 
	* BACNet/IP (in development)
	* Meter-Bus, MBus (in development)
- very low Hardware requirements for the Server

What is Working
---------------

 - Modbus TCP/RTU/BIN
 - Visa (at least for the Devices in the visa/devices folder)
 - Systemstat
 - OneWire (only DS18B20)
 - phant (no known issues)
 - smbus (at least for the Devices in the smbus/device_templates folder)
 - event (no known issues)
 - export (no known issues)
 - hmi (no known issues)

What is not Working/Missing
---------------------------

 - Documentation
 - SysV init daemon handling
 - BACNet (due to the lack of hardware to test)


Installation
------------

Detailed installation instruction can be found at: http://pyscada.rtfd.io .
